# Accessing BigConnect

BigConnect is a web application that you access through HTTPS on port 8889. . All you need to do is point your web browser at the machine where BigConnect is running and specify the port number. For example, https://YOURDOMAIN.com:8889

{% hint style="info" %}
The first time you access BigConnect it will prompt that the website uses an invalid SSL certificate. This is normal because we use a self-signed SSL certificate, so please ignore the error and continue.
{% endhint %}

BigConnect ships with a simple login screen where you only need to enter the username to access the system. If the username does not exist in the system, it will be automatically created.

{% hint style="info" %}
Every user that logs in to the system using the default configuration is granted Administrator access.
