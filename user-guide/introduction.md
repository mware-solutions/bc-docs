# Introduction

BigConnect provides an extensible Big Data platform to understand and work with any amounts of data, from any source and in any format. Itâ€™s an information-agnostic system where all data that flows into the system is transformed, mapped, enriched and then stored in a logical way using a semantic model of concepts, attributes and relationships. It provides an extensible, unified visual interface with tools for data discovery and analysis, collaboration, alerting and information management.

The platform and all its components are **open**, **extensible**, **massively scalable** and **highly secure**. It can be used to build Big Data applications that can cover most use cases and industry requirements.
