# Contributing

If you're planning on contributing to BigConnect , then it's a good idea to fork a repository first. GitHub provides [instructions for forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). After forking a BigConnect repository, you'll want to create a local clone of your fork in which to make changes before [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Here's a quick guide to creating a great pull request for one of the repositories:

1. Fork the repo
2. Run the tests. Pull requests without tests are much less likely to be merged, and it's great to know you're starting with a clean slate.
3. Add a test for your change. Refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, please include a test.
4. Make the test pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on one of the primary developers. This is an active project so you should get a response in a reasonable amount of time. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives at that time. Please don't consider the feedback as a lack of appreciation for your time and effort. It most certainly is not.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted, are:

* Include good tests
* Keep the changeset small
* Stick to existing code conventions
* Update the documentation, examples elsewhere, guides, whatever is affected by your contribution
