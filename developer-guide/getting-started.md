# Getting started

This guide is intended for those who wish to:

* Contribute code to BigConnect
* Create their own BigConnect plugins
* Create a custom build of BigConnect

In order to work with BigConnect as a developer, it's recommended that you are proficient with the following technologies:

* Java, since the entire back end is written in Java
* JavaScript, jQuery and ReactJS , since the UI is very JavaScript heavy

If that sounds like you, then please keep in mind the following conventions you'll encounter while reading this guide.

* Any reference to `$BIGCONNECT_DIR` refers to the base directory for BigConnect configuration. The most important subdirectory to this is the `config` directory, where BigConnect configuration properties files placed.
