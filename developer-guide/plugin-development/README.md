# Plugin development

Many features within BigConnect are developed and run as plugins to the system. There are four basic types of plugins:

* [Web Plugins](web-plugins/)
* [Data Worker Plugins](data-worker-plugins/)
* [Process Worker Plugins](processes-worker-plugins.md)
* [External Worker Plugins](external-worker-plugins.md)
