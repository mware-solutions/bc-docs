# Data Worker Plugins

**Data Workers** are designed for data enhancement and individual scoring analytics on each element or property of the graph. Data Workers will get notified of every change made to elements and properties in the system and allow other Data Workers to act on those changes. For example, the [PhoneNumberGraphPropertyWorker](http://localhost/java/com/mware/phoneNumber/PhoneNumberGraphPropertyWorker.html) analyzes each [property](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#property) of every element in the system and tries to determine if there is a phone number in the text. It then proposes that the phone number it found should be resolved to a [concept](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#concept) that is defined in the [ontology](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#ontology) and broadcasts the changes to the UI.

The Graph [Property](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#property) Workers follow the [blackboard design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_%28design_pattern%29) model. Each Graph [Property](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#property) Worker notifies the thread that is running it that it can work on an element and an optional [property](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#property). If the worker returns true from its [`isHandled`](http://localhost/java/com/mware/core/ingest/graphProperty/GraphPropertyWorker.html#isHandled-org.vertexium.Element-org.vertexium.Property-) method is called, then that Graph [Property](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#property) Worker's `execute` method is called with additional data. The Graph [Property](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#property) Worker is then able to contribute data or run operations on that specific element or [property](http://localhost/GLOSSARY.html#property).
